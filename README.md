# EdiFabric C# .NET Examples for VDA

## 1. Overview
EdiFabric is a software development kit for .NET Framework and .NET Core, which makes it straightforward to parse, generate, validate, acknowledge, split, customize, or in other words, to programmatically manipulate EDI files. It is written in C# and is distributed as a set of NuGet packages and C# files.  

It currently supports all message types for the X12, EDIFACT, HL7, and NCPDP EDI standards, the German automotive standard VDA, as well as custom formatted flat files (delimited, positional, or a mixture of both).  

> NOTE: EdiFabric does not provide any communication components (AS2 or SFTP, for example), has no dashboard or UI, and is not a full end-to-end EDI solution.
The best option to get the gist of what EdiFabric is, and can do, is to play around with the trial and examples.  

The examples are organized into different projects in two logical categories: by product feature and by message type.   

```C#
Stream ediStream = File.OpenRead(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory() + @"\..\..\..\Files\Vda_4905_02.txt");

List<IEdiItem> ediItems;
using (var ediReader = new VdaReader(ediStream, MessageContextFactory))
    ediItems = ediReader.ReadToEnd().ToList();
    
var transactions = ediItems.OfType<TS4905>();
```

## 2. Requirements
- Visual Studio, compatible with the supported .NET versions
- Minimum .NET Framework 4.5 or .NET Core 3.1. All projects target .NET Framework 4.5, however, the Target Framework from each project's properties can be changed to .NET Core 3.1.
- EdiFabric trial DLLs and serial number.

## 3. Serial Key and EdiFabric trial DLLs
[Download the serial key](https://sowl.co/oApEt). The serial key is included in the file serial.key in folder edifabric-trial. Ensure it is there and that the file is not empty. The serial key is loaded in the file SerialKey.cs in project EdiFabric.Examples.VDA.Common. Open the file and ensure that the serialKeyPath is correct.
If the serial key is invalid or the file is missing, contact us at https://support.edifabric.com/hc/en-us/requests/new for assistance.  
The trial DLLs are in folders net45 (for .NET Framework 4.5+) and netcoreapp3.1 (for .NET Core 3.1+).

## 4. Setup
Rebuild the solution. If there are any build errors, contact us at https://support.edifabric.com/hc/en-us/requests/new for assistance.  

## 5. Getting started
To get started, set project EdiFabric.Examples.VDA.Read as the startup project, open ReadVDA.cs and either run it as it is or change the path to point to a local 4905 test file.  

## 6. Examples by feature
Explore the different features of EdiFabric, such as translating from VDA file (Read) and generating VDA file (Write).  

## 7. VDA Validation
All trial templates in EdiFabric.Templates.Vda can be used for validation. If you need to test with a different template, please contact us.  

## 8. VDA Templates
The following templates are available out-of-the-box:

## 9. Trial use
The trial assemblies are valid for 14 days and are subject to EdiFabric's license terms available at https://www.edifabric.com/files/eula.pdf. Upon expiry, the trial packages will begin throwing exceptions.   
To continue using the trial and the examples, you'll need to either request a trial extension or replace the trial packages, together with all references to the trial packages, with the full version of EdiFabric.
