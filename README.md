# EdiFabric C# .NET Examples for VDA

## 1. Overview
EdiFabric is a software development kit for .NET Framework and .NET Core, which makes it straightforward to parse, generate, validate, acknowledge, split, customize, or in other words, to programmatically manipulate EDI files. It is written in C# and is distributed as a DLL file and a NuGet package.  

It currently supports all message types for the X12, EDIFACT, HL7, and NCPDP EDI standards, the German automotive standard VDA, as well as custom formatted flat files (delimited, positional, or a mixture of both).  

> NOTE: EdiFabric does not provide any communication components (AS2 or SFTP, for example), has no dashboard or UI, and is not a full end-to-end EDI solution.
The best option to get the gist of what EdiFabric is, and can do, is to play around with the trial and examples.  

The examples are organized into different projects in two logical categories: by product feature and by message type.   

```C#
Stream ediStream = File.OpenRead(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory() + @"\..\..\..\Files\Vda_4905_02.txt");

List<IEdiItem> ediItems;
using (var ediReader = new VdaReader(ediStream, MessageContextFactory))
    ediItems = ediReader.ReadToEnd().ToList();
    
var transactions = ediItems.OfType<TS4905>();
```

## 2. Requirements
- Visual Studio, compatible with the supported .NET versions. [Download Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
- Minimum .NET Framework 4.8 or .NET 6. Downgrading to .NET Framework 4.5 is possible by changing the target framework for each project.

## 3. Serial Key and EdiFabric trial DLLs
All projects reference EdiFabric EDI Tools as NuGet packages from nuget.org. If you wish to install EdiFabric EDI Tools as DLLs, download the trial DLLs from [here](https://support.edifabric.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000280532-Free-code-to-master-you-EDI-files).

## 4. Setup
Rebuild the solution with Package Restore enabled. If there are any build errors, manually install the missing packages from [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=edifabric). 

## 5. Getting started
To get started, set project EdiFabric.Examples.VDA.Read as the startup project, open ReadVDA.cs and either run it as it is or change the path to point to a local 4905 test file.  

## 6. Examples by feature
Explore the different features of EdiFabric, such as translating from VDA file (Read) and generating VDA file (Write).  

## 7. VDA Validation
All trial templates in EdiFabric.Templates.Vda can be used for validation. If you need to test with a different template, please contact us.
